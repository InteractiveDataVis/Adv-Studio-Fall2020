Nadya Chikurova,My first project was inspired by current situation with COVID-19. I decided to look back at the epidemics we have lived through and came across Ebola Virus data. The second project comes from personal experience; I explored how the average age of women in Russia at their first birth has been changing through time and what are the reasons for it.,https://github.com/nchikurova,https://nchikurova.github.io/Interactive-Data-Vis-Portfolio/,Data Visualization Portfolio,"project 1: https://github.com/nchikurova/Interactive-Data-Vis-Portfolio/blob/master/lib/sketches/project_1_pic.png

Nadia El Mouldi,I was motivated by my personal experience as a New Yorker and a Tunisian woman to create two data visualisation projects: the first is a mapping visualisation of New York City restaurants through their Health Inspection Grades in contrast with their Yelp Ratings. The second is a celebration of women writers from the Middle East and North Africa in which I highlight writers and their works.,https://github.com/NadiaElMouldi,https://nadiaelmouldi.github.io/Portfolio/portfolio,NYC Health Grades vs Yelp Ratings / Women Writer from the Middle East and North Africa - A repository,"project1: https://nadiaelmouldi.github.io/Portfolio/Project1/project1.gif

Valli Lakshmanan,The world is pretty complicated. There are still so many things we don't know about it yet! Luckily we all have some great tools to help us explore that unkown. Numbers and Visuals. Im interested in finding a balance between those two tools so that we can explore those parts/ideas of the world that have yet to have some light shed on them,https://github.com/v-lax,https://v-lax.github.io/Portfolio/portfolio.html,Interactive Data Visualization Portfolio (Spring 2020),Project1 - https://v-lax.github.io/Portfolio/project1.gif Project2 - https://v-lax.github.io/Portfolio/project2.gif,https://v-lax.github.io/Portfolio/project1.gif,https://v-lax.github.io/Portfolio/project2.gif

Yazid Mekhtoub,"To complete the course requirements I have developed two projects. For the first project, I developed a dashboard to visualize the confirmed COVID-19 dearths.  When the page loads the user sees a world choropleth map of COVID-19 deaths. Upon clicks, the viewer sees a line and bar charts for COVID-19 details in that particular region.  For the second project, I attempted to visualize global CO2 emission. I developed the second project combining D3JS and ReactJS. These two technologies proved to be a good combination, as they allow for efficient code reusability.",https://github.com/amazighy,https://frosty-northcutt-207c09.netlify.app/,Interactive Data Visualization Course Projects,,,

Eva Sibinga,"I was motivated to create these projects by two disparate interests: family history and ridiculous televised sports. Inspired by a family reunion I attended last year, Project 1 is a digital family tree that allows the user (presumably a member of my family) to zoom in and out, highlight parts of the tree based on name, and explore the names and dates of family members. Project 2 was basically an attempt to make a clickable dartboard, and to introduce people who know nothing about darts to the concepts one needs to know in order to understand and appreciate the televised spectacle.",https://github.com/esibinga,https://esibinga.github.io/IDV-exploratory-viz/Portfolio,Family History and Darts (two separate projects),,,
Kathia Vargas,"My project idea popped after reading an article on the FiveThirtyEight website ""Should Travelers Avoid Flying Airlines That Have Had Crashes in the Past?"" It's on my agenda to visit as many countries as I can in my lifetime. I had never thought about airline incidents before reading this article. I found it quite interesting and, I think it might be of your interest as well.",https://github.com/kathiavf16,https://kathiavf16.github.io/My_Data_Viz_Project/portfolio-home.html,Airplane Crashes and Fatalities - Final Project,,,
Annalisa Wilde,"Who pays New York state politicians campaign donations? Who spends the most? Who receives the most? These are simple questions about our political system, yet it is very hard to get answers to them. My first project is a tool to help people who are interested in NY state politics better understand the ""players"" in Albany and help local journalists who are looking for breadcrumbs that might lead to stories. My second project digs into what the data can tell us about our state political system.  Underlying both projects is a deep analysis I did of donor information. That analysis included using machine learning to “cluster” the filing data and a manual review of thousands of “clusters” of donors to make sure they were the same organizations.",https://github.com/rawild,https://rawild.github.io/InteractiveDataVis-Portfolio/,Who Pays NY?

Hope Johnson,"As a trained statistician, I like to count things. So naturally, both projects in my portfolio grew out of a simple question: “How many?” My exploratory project, “A Million Maps of Missouri”, presents an interactive display of all the possible redistricting maps in Missouri based off of the 2016 plan. My narrative project, “Who’s Still Talking About Guantanamo Bay?”, illustrates the declining number of news stories about the prison at Guantanamo Bay over the past decade. I used original data in each project, and designed them in the spirit of creating accessible, engaging, and clear presentations of the facts.

"Plummer, Matthew H","For my exploratory project, I made a geoprojection of NYC’s five boroughs, which when hovered over would fitler an area chart to show the number of COVID cases in that borough relative to the total number of cases in the city. I made this choice after being frustrated by not seeing any easy, interactable map that could tell me the number of cases by borough. For my narrative, I had a dataset of scraped urls from GoFundMe - the first 4 pages of each category - and because the set was somewhat incomplete I wanted to be thoughtful about what useful data we could glean from this dataset. I went with a bubble chart to display the percentage of individual donations relative to all donations - this helped to draw the user to see upfront that there are four main drivers of donations for GoFundMe. Then, I did a lollipop chart to display most commonly used words in a GoFundMe Description - again, to help the user see the repeating words each campaign uses. Finally I used a bee swarm chart to show sentiment analysis of each campaigns’ descriptions, allowing the user to hover and see the text in each one.",https://github.com/plummer-dataviz,https://plummer-dataviz.github.io/portfolio/,GFM Data Visualizations + Covid Cases in NYC in march,,,
"Schimmel, Seth",When did governments decide to start new policies in response to COVID-19? At what point did the scale of the global pandemic influence local policymakers to take action?  This project uses data currently being collected by the CoronaNet Research Project to visualize swarms of responses by governments in an attempt to help policy analysts and anyone interested in comparative politics to think through when and how different countries responded differently to the pandemic.,https://github.com/sethsch,https://sethsch.github.io/Interactive-Data-Vis-Sp2020/narrative_finalPost/blog-post.html,Orders of magnitude: governing signals during COVID-19,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1v3PcyoFccmvFFLxYHRCvTGdAJ2yAUBwW,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1v3PcyoFccmvFFLxYHRCvTGdAJ2yAUBwW,
